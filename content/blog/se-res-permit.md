## Part 0: 我是否需要 Residence Permit?

**我是否需要簽證？**

**In order to study for more than 90 days in Sweden, you must have a residence permit.**

如果學習超過 **90** 天，如果您不是歐盟成員國公民（[EU/​​​​​EEA citi­zens and long-term resi­dents](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/EU-EEA-citizens-and-long-term-residents.html)）都需要 residence permit

當然，如果你是：

- 美國公民
- 申根免簽國家護照持有者:[列表](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)

您可以在北美提交申請，並在入境瑞典之後領卡

當然宇宙第一豬肝紅是沒這個待遇的

**Where to？**

申請可以在線提交，但是需要本人攜帶護照原本前往 DC 的大使館並提交 biometrics（拍照 + 指紋）

DC 大使館地址（Apple Maps 上的瑞典大使館實際是列支敦士登大使館）：

> Embassy of Sweden
> 2900 K St NW
> Washington, DC 20007

建議飛至 DCA 而不是 IAD， 並預訂位於 Georgetown 的飯店（[Georgetown House](https://www.thegeorgetownhousedc.com/) 是一個不錯的選擇）

## Part 1: 材料準備

[申請入口](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Studying-in-Sweden/Higher-education/Residence-permit-for-studies-in-higher-education/Apply-for-a-residence-permit-for-studies-in-higher-education.html)

對於線上申請，你需要以下材料：

- 護照掃描件
- 錄取信
- 財力證明（9450 SEK/mon = 870 USD/mon)
- proof of insurance

以及：

- 1500.00 SEK 申請費
- USD 10 FedEx 郵寄費用（將 residence permit 郵寄至你的美國地址）
- 一段文字解釋 Why Sweden

{{< notice info >}}

1. 具體文件要求請參考：[Resi­dence permit for studies in higher educa­tion](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Studying-in-Sweden/Higher-education/Residence-permit-for-studies-in-higher-education.html#financialsupprt)
2. 財力證明可以提交 bank statement
3. 交換學生貌似都會有 Swedish State Insurance for Foreign Students in Sweden (STUDENT IN) 提供的 24/7 保險
   {{< /notice >}}

繳費遞交即可

## Part 2: 遞交

這部份其實不算是遞交，而是遞交之後會發生的事

遞交之後你會收到 payment received 和 application for residence permit submitted 2 封郵件，第二封中的 control number 可以用於免登錄查詢申請進度

之後你會收到名爲「Message from Swedish Migration Agency/Meddelande från Migrationsverket」的郵件，要求：

> Before the Swedish Migration Agency can grant a residence permit and/or work permit, you need to present your passport(s) during a personal visit to Embassy Of Sweden In Washington D.c..

他會讓你發郵件預約，當你向 [visa.washington@gov.se](mailto:visa.washington@gov.se) 發送郵件後會收到自動回覆：

> pplicants that have been informed by the Migration Agency to show their passport in original at the Embassy, can do so without booking an appointment. Please use any of our available walk-in dates and times without an appointment. _No other time slots are available._

這時你就可以開始預訂前往 DCA 的機票了

## Part 3: passport check and biometrics

瑞典大使館位於 2900 K St NW，住在 Georgetown 可以步行前往，Uber 可以直達大使館。

[Apple Maps 上標註的](<https://maps.apple.com/place?q=Embassy of Sweden&ll=38.9019689%2C-77.0586543&address=2900 K St NW%2C Washington%2C DC%20 20007%2C United States>)瑞典大使館實際上是列支敦士登大使館，瑞典大使館是河邊稍微小一點的那間。

進去通過安檢以後，右轉排隊等待即可

由於豬肝紅並不免簽申根，會需要在驗明~~正身~~護照之後進行拍照和指紋錄取

之後會讓你回到外面的 reception 填寫一張郵寄單並繳費 USD 10

## Part 4: Application Granted

在漫長的等待過後（期間不會有任何 update 或者通知），嘗試 email 對方會得到如下回答：

> The application is under process and we will contact you if we need additional information or when a decision is made.
> For more information about approximate time to a decision, please visit the following web page: [Time to a decision - Migrationsverket](https://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Contact-us/Time-to-a-decision.html)

模板回答...

在兩個月以後，終於分配到了 case officer，可能因爲已經提前提交過指紋和護照訊息，application 直接被通過，郵件內容如下：

```
Your case has been settled. Your application is granted.

Please read the entire message to get all the information you need.

If you are residing in Sweden, you will receive the complete decision by post within a week. The decision is sent to the address you have registered with the Swedish Migration Agency. If you have a legal representative in Sweden, the entire decision will be sent to him or her.

If you live outside Sweden, and want to get your complete decision, you can contact the Swedish embassy or consulate general as you specified in your application. You can read more about embassies and consulates at Sweden Abroad. Notification of the complete decision is made only if you visit the embassy or consulate general.
Residence permit card

In most cases you need a residence permit card to be able to travel to Sweden. The process to receive the residence permit card differs if you are in or outside Sweden. Please continue reading to find out how to receive your residence permit card.
If you are outside Sweden and

    have not provided your photo and fingerprints at a Swedish embassy or consulate general. In this case, you need to visit the embassy or consulate general that you specified in your application to take your photo and leave fingerprints. Do not forget to bring your passport or other equivalent ID document. See the website of the embassy or consulate general for information about visits.
    have not provided your photo and fingerprints at a Swedish embassy or consulate general and have a citizenship in a country with no requirement of a short-stay visa (learn more about which countries citizens can travel to Sweden without a visas). In this case, you can travel to Sweden and book an appointment with the Swedish Migration Agency to take a photo and leave fingerprints, but it is also possible to book an appointment at the embassy or consulate general you specified in the application.
    have already provided your photo and fingerprints. In this case, the residence permit card will be sent to the embassy or consulate general where you took the photo and left fingerprints. This takes about 3-4 weeks. The embassy or consulate general will usually contact you once they have received the card.

If you are in Sweden and

    have not taken your photo and left fingerprints for this application. In this case, you need to book an appointment for this with the Swedish Migration Agency. Do not forget to bring your passport or other equivalent ID document. Your residence permit card will be sent to the address registered with the Swedish Migration Agency in connection with your application. The card is sent within a week after the visit.
    have already had your photograph and fingerprints taken for this application. In this case, the card will be sent to the address registered by the Swedish Migration Agency in connection with your application. The card will be sent within a week.

If your permission to stay in Sweden is valid for one year or more you must visit the Swedish Tax Agency (Skatteverket) to register, if you have not already done so. To register means, among other things, that you get a Swedish personal identity number. You need to bring your residence permit card with your on the visit. In some situations, you can register yourself even if the permit is valid for less than a year. Read more about the Swedish Population Register on the website of the Swedish Tax Agency.

Please visit the page www.informationsverige.se which is a guide to Swedish society. Here is useful information about Sweden, including language, school, education, care, laws and regulations. The information is available in ten different languages.

Yours sincerely,

The Swedish Migration Agency

建議有財力購買加勒比 CBI，不要和自己過不去非要拿豬肝紅對抗歐洲效率
