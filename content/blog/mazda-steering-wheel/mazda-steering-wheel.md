I recently received my customized carbon fiber steering wheel for my Mazda and couldn’t wait to install it:

Here are some videos and manuals that I found useful during the process:

- [Cipher Auto ND MX-5 Steering Wheel Install](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY4flqbcyiw)
- [Carbon Fiber Steering Wheel - Mazda 3 & CX-30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nxeCGP4pPsY)
- [autoexe manual on their sport steering wheel](https://www.autoexe.co.jp/manual/manual/spsteering/BPA1V0310.pdf)

There aren’t many detailed walkthroughs on how to do this, so here’s how I did it:

## Step 0: Tools

- 10mm socket (battery removal)
- 8mm **deep** socket (airbag cover only)
- 21mm wrench (same as the backup tire wrench)
- a long L shape hex wrench or a long screwdriver
- a plastic plier
- power tools are a plus but not necessary

here's what I bought (NO REFFERAL ATTACHED):

## Step 1: removing the original steering wheel

before removing the steering wheel, make sure to disconnect your battery. the connector is secured with a 10mm nut, you will need a ratchet or wrench to loosen it and remove it from the negative terminal. I wrapped it with a cleaning cloth to make sure it does not come into contact with any conductors during the process:

now the steering wheel is secured with three pins (picture taken from autoexe's manual):

you will need a long screwdriver or a L shaped hex wrench to push the pin down and the cover will pop off:

{{< figure src="/blog/mazda-steering-wheel/03.webp" class="center-fig">}}

make sure you don't pull it off too hard as there are few wires behind it that you need to disconnect, the white one is the ground wire for your honk, you want to grab the tip and pull it out.

As for the orange and yellow wire, use a flathead screwdriver to lift the small black part on top before disconnecting them. This should allow them to come off easily.

The screw that holds your steering wheel is a 21mm that can be removed with the backup tire wrench. so no need to purchase an extra wrench for this.

There’s also another white connector on the top that needs to be disconnected before removing the steering wheel. Before taking it off, mark the top of the screw hole with a sharpie so you can properly align your new steering wheel when reinstalling it.

## Step 2: Transplant

The wheel is made of 5 parts, the frame itself, a back plate, control buttons, 3 pins to secure the airbag lid, and a bottom plate. Note that almost all components are secured with clips, so be extra careful about breaking those clips when you are working on them.

my customized wheel came with the bottom plate so there's no need for me to transplant it, but it is secured with two rubber pins on the front, you should be able to just pull it out:

Removing the back plate is straightforward. There are clips on three sides of the wheel, so a light pull should be enough.

Now the most difficult part is the control buttons, there are a total of 6 pins (3 each side):

{{< figure src="/blog/mazda-steering-wheel/08.webp" class="center-fig">}}

you can remove the outermost two by pushing it down, the remaining four require pulling while wiggling them. I don't have any good tips for it but be extra careful, I broke one of the clips during the process (fortunately it does not effect the buttons when I put it on to the new steering wheel)

To remove the three white clips that holds the airbag, use a stick to pull the metal clip out:

{{< figure src="/blog/mazda-steering-wheel/09.webp" class="center-fig">}}

Now that we have removed all the components from the original steering wheel, it’s time to transfer them to the new one. Insert the white pins into the socket and slide the metal pin in to secure them.

for the control buttons, Align them properly and press them down until they sit securely. And then put the back plate and bottom plate back on

## Step 3: Airbag

The airbag is secured with four 8mm nuts, and you’ll need a deep socket to remove them. (special thanks to my local autozone for letting me borrow one for free)

{{< figure src="/blog/mazda-steering-wheel/11.webp" class="center-fig">}}

After removing the four nuts, you should be able to take out the horn and metal frame. Next, loosen the six clips to remove the backplate:

now you should be able to pull the airbag out, transfer the airbag to your new steering wheel and reassemble everything in reverse order.
